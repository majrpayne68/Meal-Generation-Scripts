# Meal-Generation-Scripts
This is a Repository where I am working on my "Random Meal Generator" Script. The purpose of teh script is to give a list of meals from a defined list (Currently the list is of random food items, as I am too lazy to make a true meal list)

I intend to add the following features:
Write to a new text file - DONE
Include the required ingredients with the appending - DONE
Meal Prep and Cook Time for each meal - Incomplete
Customizable Meal Selection - Incomplete
Caloric Content of Meals - Incomplete
Toggles to Choose Desired Features (Include or remove resipe lists, calorie count, etc.) - Incomplete
